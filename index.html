      <b>Abstract:</b> Hello! For those of you who don't know me, my name is George Ridgeway and this is my website. I started
      working on this site as I was completing my Master's degree as a way to showcase the work I have done as well as the skills I have 
      learned along the way. But first, a bit about my background. 

      I attended Stetson University where I graduated <i>cum laude</i> with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics. While at Stetson, 
      I applied for and received funding to undertake a biophysics summer research project that focused on cell growth. Additionally, 
      I also completed a senior research project focusing on high-resolution planetary imaging. After graduating, 
      I worked for a few months as a Sample Receiving Technician and a Quality Control Analyst. While working, I was also submitting 
      applications for graduate school. I received an offer to join the Astrophysics program at Saint Mary's University in 
      Halifax, Nova Scotia.
